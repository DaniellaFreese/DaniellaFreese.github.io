I decided to bite the bullet officially finish frontend development training no matter how much I absolutely detest it.

It's not that it's not interesting. It's just that everytime I put together an adorable frontend UI, I spend hours doing it, it's functionaly correct, but everyone's reaction is "Wow that is an absolutely terrible design, how did you manage to make it look so bad?"

Right? Who's going to want to focus on that?

So now, the time comes, there is this CNCF project everyone is raving about, `backstage`. Oh shit, this is all typescript and react. I have no choice but to sit down, yet again, and learn from the beginning frontend development.

## Should you Become a Full Stack Developer?

Truthfully, becoming a fullstack developer is not a bad idea. Being able to express an idea quickly, build it end-to-end, and then turn around and demo it can help you with a myriad of positions and problems.

* Solution Architects

* Developer Advocates

* Customer Experience / Professional Services

* Actual Full Stack Developers

I personally came to the conclusion, being full stack will help me. Why?

1. To express ideas, even if it's half-baked, very simple, I come across situtations where I need to get an idea across and just get it done.

1. To put myself in the shoes of a frontend development work. If I understand it better, in the future it makes me a better manager, and a better leader.

## How did I get started?

The typical track is usually :

```yaml
html --> css --> javascript --> react
```

I skipped html and css, because I felt like I had played around with them enough, not a SME here, but enough to squeeze by and went straight to javascript then to react.

I did some free javascript tutorials that you can find on youtube or some other education platforms. I ran through it quickly and then put most of my focus into react.

## React vs Vue?

There is quite a bit of debate out there today on whether to learn React vs Vue.

React being the more popular choice, and Vue being the  "easier" choice.

My first objective is to complete a `backstage plugin`, hence I have to learn React.

`Pros/Cons of the decision?` Well, I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know when I get there.
