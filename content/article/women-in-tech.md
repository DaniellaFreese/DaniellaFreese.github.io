When I started to study computer science and make the transition into the field it was extremely glamorized from where I was standing. Oh cool I'm going to be a coder, and solve problems. Which don't get me wrong, it's completely valid and true. On top of that, there is also this talk of fighing the "uncious bias", and if it is exists. Then all of the sudden I would look up from my desk or office and realize hmm yeah there are in fact no women in sight. Where did they go? Hellllooooooo, but nope none there.

Now after being in industry for 6+ years, if you are wondering if I have had some rough encounters the answer is yes. There have been some weird come-upins that really only fall under the "unconious bias" umbrella.

But not so many that I feel like I'm fighting a wildfire all the time. There have definitely been a handful of occasions where clients did not want to listen, agree, discuss, practically even look anything I had to show or say. Would someone come out directly and say it was become I was a female? No... so it's purely speculative BUT if we were to take a deep psychological lense at the situation it also seemed rather obvious there there was some of that "unconious bias" was coming through.

So I just want to say, if a female is reading this and wondering should I do something else. Do it. Fuck "unconcious bias" and set your own path because it will be OKAY. Maybe we have to fight harder? Fuck it, don't let anyone dictate your future.

In the workplace you build relationships with collegues who value your opinion, or knowledge and that positive re-enforcment continues to snowball. So a couple of dudes in the workforce shoving "unconious bias" in my face isn't going to stop me. My job is learn, problem solve and deliver. If you are qualified for the job and have the merits then you will win. As my high-school chem teacher once said to me after smacking me on the head with a book: "Never say you can't do it!".
