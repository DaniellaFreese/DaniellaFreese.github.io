OpenShift is marketed at the enterprise ready flavor of Kuberentes, with all the support of Red Hat and the high quality out of the gate security offered on the platform.

That doesn't make Security on OpenShift any less confusing. There are Security Context, Pod Security Context, RBAC. When and why should you leverage RBAC and SCCS. Here are the list of my favorite blogs that I like to refer to when I need a quick reminder or a quick fix for demo. Alexendre Menezes with Red Hat does a great job explaining the basics and getting you started.

1.[Introduction to Security Context and SCCs](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/introduction-to-security-contexts-and-sccs)

2.[Managing SCCS in OpenShift](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/managing-sccs-in-openshift)

This third listing is great for the basics of security with docker.
