I took a strange direction into Software Engineering, as many of us do. Because of that I thought it  would be worthwhile to discuss the experience, document coding fiascos, or maybe just some lessons learned.

Many moons ago, I started out with a BS in Conservation Biology and continued to research physiochemical impacts on Climate Change/Plant Invasives on soil and plant ecology. It was fun, demanding, and gave me the much needed years to learn to think high level/big picture but also analytical. Then moved out to Germany/Switzerland to start a PhD, and didn't find it was for me and I ended up getting another M.S in Bioinformatics with extra study in Computer Science. So I have a hodge podge of degrees, and while it would be more convenient to have taken a more direct path to where I am today I don't think I would be the same person.

After finally decided to leave school behind, because honestly I can't live in school forever, I become a consultant supporting Red Hat technologies including Ansible, the JBoss suite, Openshift, Docker, cloud related app dev, CI/CD automation, and infrastructure. That client consulting time is really important, it gives you the chance to see what everyone is up and a perspective of all the problems out there.

Today, I recently change positions as a Partner Developer for Kong Inc., which is a multi-faceted position involving coding, general technical competency, communication, and even marketing.

Where am I today with personal education?  Well, it's backwards into AI and ML, front-end development, testing out new CNCF projects, and more cloud related technologies (wasm, proxy-wasm).

So welcome to my blog, and I hope you enjoy the content.

Also disclaimer I do also create a family outdoors/travel blog if anyone is interested [FreezingOutdoors](https://freezingoutdoors.com/) - GET IT! Because we're the Freese's.
