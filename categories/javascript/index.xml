It&amp;rsquo;s not that it&amp;rsquo;s not interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s just that everytime I put together an adorable frontend UI, I spend hours doing it, it&amp;rsquo;s functionaly correct, but everyone&amp;rsquo;s reaction is &amp;ldquo;Wow that is an absolutely terrible design, how did you manage to make it look so bad?&amp;rdquo;
Right? Who&amp;rsquo;s going to want to focus on that?</description></item></channel></rss>
